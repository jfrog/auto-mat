# How to run?
cd to the location of your heap dump file, then:
```docker run --mount src=$(pwd),target=/data,type=bind -it auto-mat:1.0 <dump filename> <heap size for mat>```
This will generate index files and 3 reports:
suspects, overview, top_components

# What problem does it solve?

Analyzing large heap dumps is a long process which needs a lot of computing resources. Eclipse Memory Analyzer Tool is GUI based tool to analyze heap dumps. It takes a lot of time to run an analysis for the first time with MAT and it consumes a lot of , however when running for the second time it is fast, thats because MAT keeps indexes locally on the running machine.

Auto-mat can help with that because it can let you run the analysis on any remote machine that has docker installed. Then you can copy the output to your local machine, run MAT and open the heap dump.
Auto-mat will also generate HTML reports which might save you the effort of running MAT.

### Example:

```docker run -it --mount src=$(pwd),target=/data,type=bind auto-mat:1.0 heap1 11g```

# How to build:

```docker build . -t auto-mat:1.0```

# How it works?

This is a simple docker wrapper for tools that came from eclipse MAT. Eclipse MAT exposes command line tool to generate indexes and reports.

# TODO:
Build the image and store in docker registry
